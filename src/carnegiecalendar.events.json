It gives communities access to employment and services like health and education. Policy recommendations, interventions, and research on PT often focuses on drivers as the primary stakeholder. This same focus is evident in the recent proliferation of machine learning (ML) interventions in PT technologies. They neglect the influence and impact of these ML interventions on other stakeholders in the PT ecosystem. This focus runs the risk of automating inequities within future mobility systems. \n\n \n\nIn this dissertation, I argue that to design for equity in public transit, we should have an understanding of the broader PT ecosystems in which we are deploying transit AI technologies. My completed research studies traverse two geographic contexts, East Africa and North America. My work shows an underlying influence of trust on relationships within the ecosystem, and unique stakeholder appropriation of transit technologies. Conversely, we also found a suspicion of advanced smart transit interfaces. Thus, we propose that to design for equity in smart transit systems, designers and researchers should consider two dimensions of trust: trust in the interfaces and trust between stakeholders within the ecosystem. My proposed work focuses on the first dimension, trust in the interface. In Study 5, we will create a taxonomy of XAI principles, essential for the creation of inclusive smart transit interfaces, through co-design activities with disabled riders in North America. In study 6, we plan to demonstrate how these principles can improve users' experiences with smart transit interfaces by testing an interface that embodies the XAI principles. This thesis makes the following major contributions: 1) Establishes a multidimensional connection between Trust and Ecosystems, 2) Demonstrates a need to understand the entire ecosystem when considering new technologies, and 3) Demonstrates how methodologies can be adapted for research in these areas.\n\n \n\nDraft document:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1FqAfd4oWNz4CNq_xHhLvcjSYP6_99BI1/view?usp=sharing        \n                                Host\n        \n          \n\n  Queenie Kravitz",

These pedagogical programs rely on government teacher training infrastructure. However, these programs face challenges in rural parts of Africa where there is a lack of experts and teachers are isolated. Therefore, pedagogical programs consider using technology to overcome some of these challenges.\n\n\n \n\n\nPrior work has used a conversational agent to address the challenges of limited expert knowledge and providing personalized interactions. Still, it is unclear how this work can translate to rural African contexts, with low technology infrastructure. Additionally, teachers in these contexts are newly adopting technology and thus require additional support to accommodate technology adoption. Therefore, there is a need to discover appropriate conversational agent designs that support these teachers implementing pedagogical programs in such low infrastructure settings.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis design process needs to overcome several practical, technological design, and theoretical challenges to find appropriate designs in this context. Beyond being usable, the designs had to support an intervention aligned with the teachers' goals and the professional development program. Lastly, theoretical grounding for designing technology in low resource contexts is still emerging.\n\n\n \n\n\nTherefore, I use an iterative design-based research (DBR) approach by working closely with teachers implementing a pedagogical program in rural Côte d’Ivoire to understand the problem context and technology designs and generate theory. My work iteratively identifies design directions and validates these directions through prototypes shared among the teacher community. In my proposed work, I intend to understand the impact of these features at scale.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis thesis proposal document describes prior work in this area (Chapter 2) before describing three studies that have been already conducted as part of the iterative design process (Study 1, 2a, 2b, and 3). My work has led to a conversational agent, which we dub 'DIA'. A key finding in these studies is that teachers valued community-based features. Therefore, I intend to learn: Will designs for community support have more impact than individual support towards teachers in low infrastructure settings?. To answer this question, I propose a large-scale and long-term study that seeks to understand the impact of community-based features at scale (Study 4).\n\n\n \n\n\nThis thesis intends to extend the literature on Human-Centered AI in low infrastructure settings through iterative design-based research. My work will also provide initial design recommendations for governments to utilize conversational agents to support teachers in implementing pedagogical programs.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn the theoretical front, my work expands designing for teacher 'aspirations' or long-term desires to allow sustainable systems. My theoretical grounding in aspirations led me to uncover the critical role of the teacher's community in supporting them in their career. Therefore, I designed participatory content in a conversational agent to allow teachers to connect to community members and rely on their collective agency. As aspirations are relatively emerging in low resource contexts for technology, my work extends the theory to designing technology.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDraft document:\n\n\nhttps://bit.ly/vikram-phd-proposal\n\n\n\n         \n                                Host\n        \n          \n\n  Queenie Kravitz",

Although cosmological evidence confirms its existence, we know very little about what dark matter really is. Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful particle accelerator ever built, are primarily positioned to help shed light on this mystery. In this talk I will guide you through the generic approach to search for dark matter at the LHC, describing the experimental techniques, how results are interpreted, and future directions to keep the LHC dark matter search program at the cutting edge.'",

This workshop will give students strategies and language to connect research into trends and put studies in conversation with each other. We will look at strong and weak examples and focus on the language they use. This workshop is appropriate for students in the sciences and humanities, writing literature reviews in journal articles, research papers, dissertations/theses, and more.
